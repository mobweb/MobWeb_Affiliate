# MobWeb_Affiliate extension for Magento

A very simple "Affiliate" extension for Magento.

## How it works/What it does

When a visitor visits any page with the *aref=your-code-here* parameter in the URL, a cookie with the value of *your-code-here* is placed in the visitors session. If that visitor places an order or signs -up for an account, that order or account is then linked to the affiliate with the code *your-code-here*.

In the backend, you can filter customers and orders by their affiliates. So you could show all orders made by customers referred by the *your-code-here* affiliate.

Feel free to open up an issue here on Github if you have any questions.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
